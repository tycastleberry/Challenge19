## Fintech Finder

The purpose of this project is to integrate the Ethereum blockchain network into an application that allows users to find fintech professionals, hire them, and pay them with cryptocurrency. First, a new Ethereum account instance needs to be generated by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache. Then, the account balance associated with the Ethereum address needs to be fetched and displayed. Next, the value of the transaction should be calculated, including the gas estimate, that pays a potential worker for their work. Lastly, the transaction should be digitially signed and sent to the Ganache blockchain before reviewing the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

## Executing and Inspecting the Transaction

The first file used is fintech_finder.py. This file will import several functions from the second file, crypto_wallet.py. To run the app, type 'streamlit run fintech_finder.py' in the terminal and your browser will open to a new webpage. On this webpage, you can select the candidate you'd like to hire, then enter the number of hours you'd like to hire them for. Clicking the 'Send Transaction' button will signa dn send the transaction with your Ethereum account information. You can then inspect the transaction in Ganache. The transaction page should look like the following screenshot:

The transaction details can then be viewed. They appear as the following:

Finally, the account balance after the transaction has taken place confirms the Ether was paid from your account:
